# Current Task: Update Fork with RID Leak Fix

## Objective
- Update the user's fork (`alienfrenZyNo1/godot-mcp`) with the commit containing the fix for the RID allocation leaks, ensuring documentation files are *not* included in this update.

## Context
- The previous task involved fixing the `add_node` tool and preparing a PR.
- Further testing revealed similar RID allocation leaks in other scene modification tools (`load_sprite`, `create_scene`, `export_mesh_library`, `save_scene`).
- These leaks were traced back to missing `scene_root.free()` calls in the corresponding functions within `src/scripts/godot_operations.gd`.
- The fix involved adding the necessary `scene_root.free()` calls to all affected functions.

## Completed Steps
1.  Identified missing `scene_root.free()` calls in `create_scene`, `load_sprite`, `export_mesh_library`, and `save_scene` functions in `src/scripts/godot_operations.gd`.
2.  Applied the fix by adding the `scene_root.free()` calls to these functions using `replace_in_file`.
3.  Rebuilt the project (`npm run build`).
4.  Successfully tested the `load_sprite` tool, confirming the RID leak was resolved.
5.  Successfully used the `save_scene` tool to persist the changes.
6.  Updated `cline_docs` (`currentTask.md`, `projectRoadmap.md`, `codebaseSummary.md`) to reflect the completion of the RID leak fix across multiple tools.

## Next Steps
- Stage the documentation changes (`git add cline_docs/`).
- Debugged and fixed the `resave_resources` tool:
    - Modified `godot_operations.gd` to handle optional parameters correctly.
    - Added debugging logs to trace parameter parsing in GDScript.
    - Modified `index.ts` (`handleUpdateProjectUids`) to check for the correct stdout message ("Resave operation complete").
    - Added a delay (`OS.delay_msec(100)`) before `quit()` in `godot_operations.gd` to attempt to fix output flushing issues.
    - Modified `index.ts` (`handleUpdateProjectUids`) again to infer success based on exit code 0 and lack of "ERROR" in stderr, as stdout parsing remained unreliable.
- Rebuilt the server (`npm run build`) multiple times.
- Confirmed `resave_resources` works correctly after server restart.

## Next Steps
- Stage the code changes (`src/index.ts`, `src/scripts/godot_operations.gd`).
- Commit the code changes with an appropriate message.
- Push the commit to the user's fork (`fork main`).
- Update local documentation (`cline_docs/`) and commit separately (locally only).
